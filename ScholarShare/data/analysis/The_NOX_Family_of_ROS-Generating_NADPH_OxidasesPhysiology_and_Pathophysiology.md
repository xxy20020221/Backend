The description of NOX family members in this review focuses on mammalian NOX homologs and subunits ([Table 1](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#T1)). Some features that are invariable for mammalian NOX enzymes (e.g., electron transfer to oxygen) might be different in nonmammalian organisms (e.g., ferric reductases in yeast).

All NOX family members are transmembrane proteins that transport electrons across biological membranes to reduce oxygen to superoxide. In accordance with this preserved function, there are conserved structural properties of NOX enzymes that are common to all family members. Starting from the COOH terminus, these conserved structural features include *1*) an NADPH-binding site at the very COOH terminus, *2*) a FAD-binding region in proximity of the most COOH-terminal transmembrane domain, *3*) six conserved transmembrane domains, and *4*) four highly conserved heme-binding histidines, two in the third and two in the fifth transmembrane domain ([Fig. 1](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#F1)). Given the additional NH2-terminal transmembrane domain, the histidines are in the fourth and sixth transmembrane domains in DUOX proteins. Additional features, such as EF hands, an additional NH2-terminal transmembrane domain, and/or a peroxidase homology domain, are limited to some of the family members and are discussed in the respective sections.

**FIG. 1.**Proposed structure of the core region of NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes. No crystal structure data of NOX enzymes are presently available. A consensus regarding basic features of the core region of NOX enzymes has emerged based on indirect data. All NOX family members share six highly conserved transmembrane domains. Transmembrane domains III and V each contain two histidines, spanning two asymmetrical hemes. The cytoplasmic COOH terminus contains conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and NADPH binding domains. NOX enzymes are thought to be single electron transporters, passing electrons from NADPH to FAD, to the first heme, to the second heme, and finally to oxygen. Enlarged circles represent amino acids that are conserved through human NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, and NOX4.

Most data suggest that the new NOX family members are also selective for NADPH over NADH. However, some researchers feel that the issue is not entirely resolved and therefore apply the term *NAD(P)H oxidase* when referring to NOX family members. We discuss in the respective sections the present knowledge about NADPH versus NADH usage by the different NOX family members.

### 1. NOX2: prototype NOX

NOX2, also known as gp91phox, is the prototype NADPH oxidase. Its biochemical features have been extensively studied and abundantly reviewed in the recent past ([44](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R44), [175](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R175), [652](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R652), [750](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R750), [917](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R917)). Thus an extended coverage of NOX2 goes beyond the scope of this review. However, we summarize the most important features of NOX2, with a particular focus on the properties of NOX2 that allow a better understanding of other NOX isoforms.

Much of what is known about the topography and structure of the NOX isoforms is derived from studies on NOX2. Yet, even for NOX2, the suggested topographical features are deduced from indirect data and hence are putative assignments. Definitive assignments will have to await crystallographic studies, which unfortunately have not been achieved yet. Still, it is likely that the basic features, outlined in [Figure 1](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#F1), are correct. Hydropathy plots predict between four and six transmembrane domains for NOX2 ([365](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R365), [800](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R800)). Phage display library screening provide experimental data defining the extracellular domains ([118](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R118), [406](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R406), [644](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R644)). Antibody mapping studies demonstrate a cytoplasmic localization of the COOH terminus ([119](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R119), [406](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R406), [757](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R757)). Sequencing data and antibody mapping confirm a cytoplasmic NH2 terminus ([676](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R676), [865](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R865)), over the alternative suggestion that the NH2 terminus is proteolytically cleaved ([143](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R143)). Taken together, the available data suggest that NOX2 has six transmembrane domains and that its COOH terminus and its NH2 terminus are facing the cytoplasm.

Human NOX2 is a highly glycosylated protein that appears as a broad smear on SDS-PAGE reflecting the heterogeneity of glycosylation. The fully glycosylated form runs with an apparent molecular mass of ∼70–90 kDa. Removal of the carbohydrates by endoglycosidase F leaves a protein that runs at 55 kDa, demonstrating the extent of glycosylation ([351](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R351)). The carbohydrate chains are composed of *N*-acetylglucosamine and galactose and, to a lesser extent, frucose, mannose, and glucose ([351](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R351)). A mutagenesis approach demonstrates that the carbohydrates are bound to asparagine residues (132Asn, 149Asn, and 240Asn) in the second and third predicted extracellular loops ([929](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R929)).

The activation of NOX2 occurs through a complex series of protein/protein interactions ([Fig. 2](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#F2); for more detailed recent reviews, see Refs. [328](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R328), [652](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R652), [844](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R844)). NOX2 constitutively associates with p22phox. Indeed, the NOX2 protein is unstable in the absence of p22phox, and phagocytes from p22phox-deficient patients have no detectable NOX2 protein ([217](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R217), [692](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R692), [828](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R828)). Activation of NOX2 requires translocation of cytosolic factors to the NOX2/p22phox complex ([Fig. 3](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#F3)). The present working model is as follows. Phosphorylation of p47phox leads to a conformational change allowing its interaction with p22phox ([327](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R327), [843](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R843)). It is thought that p47phox organizes the translocation of other cytosolic factors, hence its designation as “organizer subunit.” The localization of p47phox to the membrane brings the “activator subunit” p67phox into contact with NOX2 ([342](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R342)) and also brings the small subunit p40phox to the complex. Finally, the GTPase Rac interacts with NOX2 via a two-step mechanism involving an initial direct interaction with NOX2 ([214](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R214)), followed by a subsequent interaction with p67phox ([476](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R476), [508](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R508)). Once assembled, the complex is active and generates superoxide by transferring an electron from NADPH in the cytosol to oxygen on the luminal or extracellular space.

**FIG. 2.**Molecular interactions of cytoplasmic organizer and activator subunits. NOX1, NOX2, and NOX3 require cytoplasmic subunits for activation. In general, p47phox is thought to be the organizer subunit of NOX2, and NOXO1 for NOX1 and NOX3. p67phox is the activator subunit for NOX2, and NOXA1 is the activator subunit for NOX1. In the human system, NOX3 does not appear to require an activator subunit. *A*: the two organizer homologs, p47phox and NOXO1, share a similar set of motifs. Both have NH2-terminal “phox homology” (PX) domains that bind to phospholipids in the membrane, although they differ in phospholipid specificity. They also both interact through tandem Src homology 3 (SH3) domains with the proline-rich region (PRR) of p22phox. Only p47phox, but not NOXO1, has an autoinhibitory region (AIR) that is inactivated upon phosphorylation, allowing interaction of the tandem SH3 domain with p22phox. Finally, both p47phox and NOXO1 contain COOH-terminal PRRs, which allow interaction with p67phox and NOXA1, respectively. Both p47phox and NOXO1 might also directly interact with their respective NOX enzymes. *B*: the two activator homologs, p67phox and NOXA1, also share a similar overall domain structure. Both have NH2-terminal tetricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that interact with Rac. Both have activation domains (AD); the functional role of this domain is thus far only documented for the p67phox-NOX2 interaction. p67phox and NOXA1 have COOH-terminal SH3 binding domains, which interact with p47phox and NOXO1, respectively. The phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain of p67phox interacts with p40phox.

**FIG. 3.**Assembly of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase NOX2. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase was the first identified and is the best studied member of the NOX family. It is highly expressed in granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages and contributes to killing of microbes. In resting neutrophil granulocytes, NOX2 and p22phox are found primarily in the membrane of intracellular vesicles. They exist in close association, costabilizing one another. Upon activation, there is an exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac leading to its activation. Phosphorylation of the cytosolic p47phox subunit leads to conformational changes allowing interaction with p22phox. The movement of p47phox brings with it the other cytoplasmic subunits, p67phox and p40phox, to form the active NOX2 enzyme complex. Once activated, there is a fusion of NOX2-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane or the phagosomal membrane. The active enzyme complex transports electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH to extracellular or phagosomal oxygen to generate superoxide (O2−).

NOX2 can be regarded as a transmembrane redox chain that connects the electron donor ([Fig. 1](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#F1)), NADPH on the cytosolic side of the membrane with the electron acceptor, oxygen on the outer side of the membrane. It transfers electrons through a series of steps involving a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), binding to amino acids 337HPFTLSA and 355IRIVGD ([917](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R917)) and two assymetrical hemes found in transmembrane domains III and V, with the inner heme binding to histidines H101 and H209 and the outer heme binding to histidine H115 and H222 ([262](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R262)).

In the first step, electrons are transferred from NADPH to FAD, a process that is regulated by the activation domain of p67phox ([658](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R658)). NOX2 is selective for NADPH over NADH as a substrate, with *K*m values of 40–45 μM versus 2.5 mM, respectively ([160](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R160)). In the second step, a single electron is transferred from the reduced flavin FADH2 to the iron center of the inner heme. Since the iron of the heme can only accept one electron, the inner heme must donate its electron to the outer heme before the second electron can be accepted from the now partially reduced flavin, FADH. The force for the transfer of the second electron, while smaller (31 vs. 79 mV), is still energetically favorable. However, the transfer of the electron from the inner heme to the outer heme is actually against the electromotive force between these two groups. To create an energetically favorable state, oxygen must be bound to the outer heme to accept the electron ([175](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R175), [223](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R223), [917](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R917)).

NOX2 was first described in neutrophils and macrophages and is often referred to as the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. NOX2 is still widely considered to have a very limited, essentially phagocyte-specific tissue expression (e.g., Ref. [844](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R844)), yet when tissue distribution of total mRNA from various organs is investigated, NOX2 appears to be among the most widely distributed among the NOX isoforms ([Table 2](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#T2)). It is described in a large number of tissues, including thymus, small intestine, colon, spleen, pancreas, ovary, placenta, prostate, and testis ([143](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R143)). Mostly this wide tissue distribution is due to the presence of phagocytes and/or blood contamination in the tissues from which total mRNA has been extracted. However, there is now also increasing evidence at both the message and the protein level for expression of NOX2 in nonphagocytic cells, including neurons ([806](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R806)), cardiomyocytes ([372](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R372)), skeletal muscle myocytes ([426](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R426)), hepatocytes ([739](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R739)), endothelial cells ([313](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R313), [434](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R434), [538](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R538)), and hematopoietic stem cells ([704](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R704)).

[Enlarge table](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#)

In phagocytes, NOX2 localizes to both intracellular and plasma membranes in close association with the membrane protein p22phox ([97](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R97), [394](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R394)). In resting neutrophils, most of the NOX2 localizes to intracellular compartments, in particular secondary (i.e., specific) granules ([26](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R26), [97](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R97), [439](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R439)) and tertiary (i.e., gelatinase-containing) granules ([465](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R465)). Upon phagocyte stimulation, there is a translocation of NOX2 to the surface as the granules fuse with the phagosomal or the plasma membrane ([97](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R97), [286](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R286), [304](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R304)). This fusion is thought to be a key event for the microbicidal activity of NOX2. However, NOX2 can also be activated within the granules without a need for fusion with surface membranes ([562](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R562), [898](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R898)). The resulting intracellular ROS generation might be involved in signaling functions of NOX2 ([439](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R439)).

In cells other than phagocytes, the subcellular distribution varies depending on the specific cell type. In smooth muscle cells, NOX2 is found to colocalize with the perinuclear cytoskeleton ([538](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R538)). In hippocampal neurons, NOX2 is suggested to be localized in the membranes of synaptic sites ([866](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R866)), possibly playing a role in superoxide-dependent long-term potentiation and memory function.

The human and mouse NOX2 gene is located on the X chromosome. At the transcriptional level, a promoter region sufficient for NOX2 expression in monocytes lies in the 450-bp region before the transcriptional start site ([818](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R818)). However, additional regulatory regions located up to 60 kb upstream from the start site also influence expression, with sensitive regions at −13, −15, −28, and −29 kb ([545](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R545)). NOX2 gene expression is regulated by repressing and activating factors. Repressing factors include the CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) ([563](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R563), [819](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R819)), HOXA10, and Meis1 ([76](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R76)). Activating factors include PU.1, Elf-1, YY1, and interferon regulatory factors IRF1 and IRF2 ([243](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R243), [422](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R422), [850](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R850), [924](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R924)), NFκB ([28](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R28)), HOXA9 ([76](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R76)), and PB1 ([76](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R76)). The PU.1 transcription factor appears to have a particularly important role in the expression of NOX2, as PU.1-deficient mice fail to express NOX2 ([850](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R850)). Mutations in the NOX2 promoter region at positions −53, −52, or −50 interfere with PU.1 binding, and CGD patients with such mutations do not express NOX2 in neutrophils, monocytes, and B lymphocytes. However, the importance of the PU.1 promoter may be somewhat cell specific, as these patients do express NOX2 in eosinophils ([850](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R850)).

NOX2 gene expression is inducible. This has been demonstrated in phagocytes in response to interferon-γ (mRNA) ([654](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R654)), in myofibroblasts after carotid artery injury (mRNA) ([856](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R856)), and in cardiomyocytes after acute myocardial infarction (protein) ([488](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R488)). NOX2 expression is also increased in response to angiotensin II in adipose tissue (mRNA) ([359](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R359)), aorta (mRNA) ([359](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R359)), heart (mRNA) ([359](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R359)), resistance artery vascular smooth muscle cells (mRNA and protein) ([881](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R881)), and pancreatic islets (protein) ([648](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R648)). Note however that an increase in NOX2 levels is not invariably due to transciptional activation. In the case of resistance arteries, the angiotensin II-induced NOX2 elevation may be due to increased de novo protein synthesis, regulated at a posttranscriptional level ([881](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00044.2005#R881)).
